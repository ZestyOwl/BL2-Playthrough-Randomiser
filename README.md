Using the BL2 Playthrough Randomiser:

There are two modes for the randomiser: BL2 (Normal), or BL2JTTW (Completely Random)

After the terminal screen is finished with, a copy of your playthrough will appear in your home directory, not in your documents. 
It will be called Loadout_Date and Time.txt

For BL2, you will get a selection of choices for ways to randomise your playthrough. 
Adding a dose of insanity will make the game significantly harder in sometimes annoying ways.

BL2JTTW will take the element of choice away from you entirely, randomising in a playthrough that could be incredibly simple, or almost impossibly difficult.
